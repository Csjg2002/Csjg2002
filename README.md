<h1>Hi, I'm Cameron! <br/><a href="https://github.com/Csjg2002">Junior Developer at ToastieLabs</a>

<h2>🤷‍♂️ About Me:</h2>

Hi, my name is Cameron. I have a background in Digital Games Design and Development, and I am deeply passionate about games and game-related software. I have completed courses in C# and Unreal Engine Blueprints and I am confident using both Unreal Engine and Unity.

After graduating with a first-class honours degree, I was offered a full-time role as a Junior Games Developer at Toastie Labs in Gateshead, where I had previously interned for seven months. In this role, I am working on an exciting new game project, gaining hands-on experience in programming, collaborating with a talented team, and learning the ins and outs of how a games development studio operates.
